You rule over your territory for several uneventful years before your goblin minions begin to report some disturbing news.  They have seen another dragon raiding within your territory, seizing tribute that ought to be yours, and eating your prey.  Based on their description, you realize that the dragon is none other than your elder clutchmate, Axilmeus.

Axilmeus was always an overbearing brute, seeking to seize what did not belong to him.  (You may recall what he did to your golden shield.)
 
What do you do about Axilmeus's incursion into your domain?
 
*choice
  #This is intolerable.  Axilmeus must be destroyed!
    How dare he enter your territory?  His effrontery leaves you no choice.
 
    Vigilance increases.
    
    Your rapid response also prevents him from taking some of your
    tribute.
    
    Wealth increases.

    *set wealth +500
    *goto Conflict
  #Another dragon on the far reaches of my territory is not worth a response.
    You ignore Axilmeus's hunting and his raids on humans who pay you tribute.  After a few weeks, however, he begins to attack caravans carrying tribute directly to you and to move ever closer to your lair.  You know that he will continue to take more and more of what is rightfully yours unless you stop him.  Battle cannot be avoided.
 
    Disdain increases.

As your elder clutchmate, Axilmeus is a foe worthy of respect.
 
How do you plan to defeat him?

  #Wait for him to come to me.  He'll need to, eventually, and I'll have the advantage.
     *goto Wait
  #Set up an ambush for him.
    Clever.  It will be a little challenging, though, and you'll need good bait.  Are you willing to risk some of your hoard as bait for him?
    *choice
      #Of course!  There's no risk, because my ambush will certainly succeed.
        That's the spirit!
 
        *goto Ambush
      #Well, when you put it that way, maybe not….
         Then you need to pick another choice:

  #Confront him in the air, relying on my superior aerial maneuver skills.
    *goto Aerial_battle
  #Just head in his general direction and beat him into the ground like the cur he is.

  #Trick Axilmeus into fighting one of my enemies.
    *goto Trick
  #Bribe him to leave my territory and never return.

*label Wait
 
You set up in your lair and wait.  You make sure to fly near enough to Axilmeus that he is aware of you, while staying far enough away that he can't engage you directly. Meanwhile, Axilmeus rampages across your territory.  His depredations make you antsy—instinct pushes you to meet the threat directly.

*if  (disdain > 60)
  With your high Disdain, you resist the urge to respond intemperately.  Axilmeus's raiding is annoying, but you put it out of your mind.  Eventually, he decides that he is unwilling to have you within the territory that he now views as his own. 
  
  In the meantime, you command your goblins to build a series of traps into your lair that can restrain Axilmeus.
  
  Your plan is working. Cunning and Disdain increase.

    Axilmeus storms directly into your lair, but your feeble defenses don't do much to slow him down.  You are not sufficiently cunning to trap a dragon as savvy as Axilmeus.

  You try to wait him out, but you can't stand it—your Disdain isn't high enough.  After Axilmeus burns a forest that you particularly liked hunting in, you lose your temper and charge out of your lair at him, determined to fight him immediately.

  You arrange for a caravan to carry a sizable portion of your hoard along past Axilmeus. The caravan makes a big show of its wealth, and Axilmeus inevitably feels the need to attack the caravan.
 
  While the caravan distracts him, you pounce on him from behind.  You drive him to the ground with your weight, ripping into him with claws and teeth.  Axilmeus struggles, but he is no match for you.

  As you wait, a fire breaks out in the forest between you and the caravan.  The smoke blocks your view—flying forth while you can't see would both eliminate the trap and risk your flying into an ambush.
 
  But when the smoke clears, you realize that Axilmeus has tricked you.  He must have lit the fire.  While it burned, he raided the caravan and carried off 1000 gold coins of your precious hoard.  Curses!
 
  You'll need to choose a different way to deal with Axilmeus.

  Because you are flying directly out of the sun, Axilmeus doesn't see you until you are nearly upon him.  He tries to maneuver, but you slam into his back before he can adjust his position. The impact breaks one of his wings, and he falls to the ground in your claws.

Your muscles are stronger than his, your teeth and claws are sharper, and, perhaps most importantly, your killer instinct and drive to crush all who oppose you is more intense.

After a long struggle, Axilmeus rakes you across the belly with his claws.  He hurts you badly, ripping away some armored plates that will never regrow and leaving a sore spot on your belly that will always bother you in the future.  But despite his success, that attack turns the battle in your favor.  Axilmeus exposes his neck as he overextends on the attack, and you counter-attack with a vicious bite.  Forcing yourself to keep battling despite the pain, you pound him with attack after attack.  Finally, you break his resistance.  Axilmeus stops trying to defeat you and starts simply trying to survive.

As you struggle to survive, he stomps on your ribs, snapping the iron-hard bones like twigs.  Every breath for the rest of your life is a little harder and a little more painful.  You struggle desperately, hoping somehow to survive, as he plays with you with increasing cruelty.
 
Finally, however, Axilmeus makes a mistake.  As he gloats and belittles you, he turns his attention away for just long enough, and you lash out with one last swipe of your claws.  You catch him across the eyes, gouging out one altogether and leaving the other blinded with blood and bone fragments.  Now, you are able to gain the upper hand.  You quickly press your advantage and defeat Axilmeus, but the battle has cost you badly.

He immediately shoots into the air, winging away as fast as he can.  You hurry out from the trees and leap into flight just as he disappears behind a hill.

Axilmeus is dangerous, but you can turn that into an advantage by arranging for him to battle one of your enemies.  Besides, if two of your enemies fight, you always end up ahead.

Some of your subjects have complained to you about a wizard…Vermias, Vormius, something like that.  You haven't bothered to learn her name yet, since she clearly isn't a threat to you.  Apparently, she has been performing strange experiments on local people and other animals in the kingdom, and she defends her territory vigorously.  If Axilmeus can eliminate her, so much the better.

How do you arrange for Axilmeus to fight her?

          You fly out towards Axilmeus, giving the impression that you intend to duel him in the air.  You then curve away and beat steadily towards Vermias's tower.  Axilmeus chases you, but you easily elude him.  Finally, as you near Vermias's tower, you climb rapidly.
          
          Axilmeus flies up to meet you, but then stops to notice something inside the tower.  From this angle, you can't quite see what he's looking at, but you can certainly guess, as a forked lighting bolt shoots out from the tower, stunning him.  Another lighting bolt shoots out in your general direction, but you dodge it easily.

          You fly away without waiting to see who prevails.  In any event, you do not hear any further reports of Axilmeus threatening your territory.  Mission accomplished.
