You are lounging on your treasure horde when you hear the sounds of booted feet coming bravely towards your treasure chamber.

The gait is that of a goblin, but what goblin wears boots? The creature who enters is walking bravely forward, clearly scared of you but secure in the notion that he's doing the right thing.

He is armed with a small sword—a long knife, really—and wears a crude helmet that clearly used to be a kitchen implement.

He begins to speak.  Like all goblins, his voice is nasal, but he puffs out his chest and begins to speak in important-sounding tones.

"O great dragon," he quavers, "I am Thokket of this tribe.  I have known all my life that I am destined for greatness.  Possessed as I am of a noble soul, I have practiced for many months and have mastered the art of martial combat.  In your name, I wish to ride out on the field of combat and prove my worth as a true hero.  One day, I shall return with a great treasure to add to your magnificent hoard.  Will you grant me your blessing on my quest?"

*choice
    #Eat him.
        *label eat
        Good move.  Experience has shown clearly that heroes are nothing but trouble.  He's got a little more meat on him than your average goblin, which makes his cries for mercy all the more delicious!

    #Grant him my blessing.

        "Thank you, master!  I swear that I will make you proud of me!"
       
        Other than encouragement, are you going to help him along in any way?
       
        *choice
            #Give him some real weapons.
                That's generous of you.  Maybe your investment in him will pay
                off some day.
               
                Do you want to send him off in a general direction?

                        #Point him in the general direction of my clutchmate.
                            *goto clutchmate
                    #Direct him toward the capitol of my kingdom.
                        *goto capitol
                    #Urge him to attack a neighboring kingdom.
                        *goto neighbors
                    #Let him fend for himself.
                        *goto fend

                #Point him in the general direction of my clutchmate.
                    *label clutchmate
                    Your clutchmate kills him, but he does manage to annoy Axilmeus somewhat, which is really all you could ask from a minion of his stature.

                Do you plan to send word of his arrival?
               
                *choice
                    #Tell them to kill the crazed beast.
                        At a word from you, they kill him.  All's well that ends well, I suppose.
                        *finish
                    #Tell them to honor him as a hero.
                        They welcome the "hero" reluctantly into their cities; they give him a small riding pony.  Eventually, he wanders over to the neighboring kingdom in search of treasure.

                    #Tell them nothing; just wait and see what they do.
                        Humans don't take kindly to hostile goblins; they kill him. All's well that ends well, I suppose.
                        *finish

                *label neighbors
                He manages to get himself killed, but he does do some damage. He proudly carries a banner of your kingdom and yells your name loudly when he rides out onto the field of battle.
               
                This starts something of an international incident; the neighboring kingdom begins skirmishing with yours.  You have not heard the end
                of this.

            #Let him fend for himself.

                Eventually, he wanders over to the neighboring kingdom in search
                of treasure.
               
                *goto neighbors
    #Test his prowess.
        You put him through some simple tests of skill and bravery.  He's tougher than the average goblin, but not all that tough; his overabundance of sheer determination to succeed—despite all odds—compensates for whatever he may lack in general prowess.
       
        *choice
            #Eat him.
                *goto eat

        He looks crestfallen.  "Y—yes, master."
        
        How pathetic.  You nestle back down into your pile of gold coins.
       
        *page_break
        But he's back again, not a week later.
       
        "Master, I can't ignore my destiny!  I know I risk the ultimate penalty for questioning your will, but I accept that risk willingly!  Please, grant me your blessing to quest in your holy name!"
       
        Persistent, isn't he?  What do you do with a goblin minion who won't take "no" for an answer?
