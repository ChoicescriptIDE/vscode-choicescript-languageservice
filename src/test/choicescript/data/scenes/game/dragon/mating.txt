You spend the next five years leisurely hunting, recounting your hoard, and sleeping for months at a time. It's a pretty nice life, but you also feel quite lonely at times. Occasionally, you imagine what it would be like to find a mate.

You wake up in the middle of the night on your enormous bed of treasure; you realize that you were dreaming of a romantic partner, one who could put fire in your life again.

How are you going to find ${him}?

        The problem with going out and hunting is that you must leave your treasure hoard unattended for some time.  In your absence, someone may try to steal your treasure.
        
        How concerned are you about this?
        
        *choice
            #Extremely concerned.
                That's understandable.  Do you still want to go hunting at all?

                That's only reasonable.  How far are you willing to go to hunt for a mate?
                
                *choice

                        Unfortunately, you can't find another dragon in such a small area; you probably would have heard of ${him} already if ${he} were already so near.

More than one, actually.

To the north, you find a green dragon with a long spiked tail and kite-shaped plates on ${his} back. $!{he} terrorizes the countryside with ${his} fiery breath.

To the west, there's a subtle, elegant black serpent.  They say that ${he} sometimes takes human form and walks among the people, whispering in the ears of kings.

To the south, you encounter an enormous scaly sea-monster; when ${he} breaches, ${he} leaps out of the water seven times without exposing all of ${his} scales to the air. $!{he} has dragged countless ships to the bottom of the sea, where ${he} keeps a vast hoard of ancient treasures.

To the east lives a strange five-clawed luck dragon with flowing whiskers, revered by the humans around ${him} as like unto a god.

Which of these mates most interests you?
