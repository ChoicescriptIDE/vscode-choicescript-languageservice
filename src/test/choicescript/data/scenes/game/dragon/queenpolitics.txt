You look down from your lair at the lands beyond your mountain. Those green lands are full of humans, and humans have large reserves of livestock and rich treasure. Shouldn't that food and wealth be yours instead?

Let's be clear about why you plan on conquering the humans.  What's most important to you?
*fake_choice
    #I need to ensure a steady supply of prey.
        The humans should have vast herds of cows and horses. Intimidate them into bringing you some weekly, and you'll have that much more time to eat.
    #I need an easy supply of princes and princesses to kidnap. I'm a stickler for tradition.
        What's a lair without a captive royal to chat with? Besides, kidnapping royalty brings knights in shining armor, and they're always particularly 
        tasty.
    #I need heaping great piles of gold and loot to adorn my lair.
        Dragons without hoards are nothing more than scaly failures. You can hear the gold sing to you, and you want more of it.
    #I want to make humans into my terrified subjects.
        Goblins are nice, but it's your right to have a better cut of minions. Cringing human slaves really brighten up the ol' lair.

        You soar above the local village.  From here you can see fields of crops, shepherds with their flocks, and a few wagons filled with vegetables. It's fairly small, though.  In the center of the village you can see a hanging banner, displaying the livery of the queen.

        What do you do to the village?
        *choice
            #Set the town afire and suffer no one to live.
                You make several passes, lighting the buildings on fire.  As the people pour out of their homes, you touch down periodically to eat a few and mangle a few more, and then you lift off again to catch a few people who thought they could escape.  Finally, the only people left alive are a handful of farmers cowering in a golden wheat field.  You fly past, allowing them to think they've evaded you, and then with a single puff you light the whole field afire, burning them alive.
                
                Brutality and Infamy increase.

                            You settle in and continue applying your toll to every caravan that comes through.  The merchants grumble, but they start to calm down after they realize that you've squeezed out the bandits from this route—after all, who's crazy enough to compete with a dragon?  You pull in a lot of money, but you're still relieved when it's time to move on.

You just can't make yourself stay in the pass, not for small sacks of gold collected like a functionary.  You fly home to your lair in less than a month.

                You pick through the wagon train, looting it thoroughly.  Some wagons have low value trade goods that you simply fling over the precipice to their destruction.  Several are loaded down with salted meats that make a nice snack.  And a few others represent the jackpot:  gold- and silverwork.  Those wagons you carry back to your lair.

A flick of your tail knocks them to the ground and you loom above them.  Just when they are convinced that their deaths are at hand, you roar, "Let the world know of my power. My name is ${name}! Let the world know, and despair!"

One of the guards tries to make his way down the almost vertical cliff face to escape—a clever thought, but for nought.  He's nicely tenderized when you get around to scraping him off the base of the mountain.  All in all, a delightful bit of carnage.

        One of your goblin slaves cowers before you. "Yes, O great and mighty master?" she squeaks.

        "I want a kingdom," you growl as you roll over on your pile of treasure. "Go down the mountain and inform the humans that I will be their new monarch."

        The goblin looks horrified, as far as that sort of thing goes; it's always hard to tell with goblins. (They're so ugly.) "But master, they'll kill me immediately!"

        You snort, sending flames into the air. "Just tell them that if they do, my vengeance will be horrible to behold."

        She almost looks hopeful. "Will it?"

        "Yes. But you'll still be dead. So don't fail me."

It doesn't take long before you are circling over their puny city; it would burn beautifully, and you could smash it into flinders, but it's full of wealth. You can smell the treasure from here. You settle heavily in the main plaza in front of the palace.  As you land, your tail idly destroys the ancient statue of some dead king.

"Send out your queen!" you roar. People flee from the sound of your voice. "I demand to talk to her. Send her out, or I'll rip apart the castle piece by piece and then eat her once I'm done. NOW!"

Someone screams. You see worried courtiers staring at you from around the door to the palace, then hastily ducking back inside. From behind, the sound of a horse distracts you. You smell weapon oil and metal.

"Avaunt, foul beast!" challenges a human encased in metal armor. He carries a long lance with a pennant flying from it. "I am Sir Rodegard, knight of—"

The knight rolls and awkwardly tries to get to his feet. As he does, he looks up to see you dangling the remains of the plaza's statue over his head. "Duck," you suggest, and he does. Then your head 
                 snaps down and catches him in your jaw. He struggles, half in and half out of your mouth, as you decide whether to eat him.

With a flick of your neck, you fling him into a nearby building.  You hear bones snap as he hits the wall and promptly forget about him.

He reins his horse to a halt and cries upwards, "Come down and fight honorably!" Instead, you breathe fire on him. He's still alive as his horse catches fire beneath him, but not for long. You're picking your teeth with the cooling remains of his lance when the queen cautiously pokes her head out from around the palace doors, sighs, and emerges out into the courtyard.

You roar, a noise that shatters windows and causes his horse to flinch, and you slap your claw down on top of him. He dodges to the side, throwing himself off his horse, and you feel the beast's blood pumping out over your scales as you simply squeeze. The horse gives a shriek.   
                         "I'm sorry," you say, "were you using this?" Then you casually lower the horse's remains into your own maw.

                         The knight is senseless with fury as he draws a sword and charges. He's braver than he is skilled; you allow him to hack at your side for a minute or two before you pick him up with two pinched claws. "Are you quite done?"

Mustering whatever dignity she can, the human queen steps outside the doors to her palace. You can smell her fear, and her courtiers beg her not to, but she emerges to meet you with what passes for human courage. You smile, a terrible sight.

You place your mouth up to the door of the palace and give a quick breath of fire, enough to get their attention but not enough to burn down the place. You then shatter a few homes for good measure. 

        You round up the ex-queen's advisors.  You kill a few to motivate the rest and force the survivors to abase themselves before you.  As your new slaves cower before you, one of the former queen's advisors shouts out to the terrified populace, "Behold our new master, ${name}! To defy the dragon is death!"  Good, they understand the way things work now.  They are terrified of you, and you can expect their tribute.

                    She is surprisingly brave to attack you with no hope of success.  She is also surprisingly tasty, as you discover while chewing on her.

Alternately, I could decimate your kingdom; your few remaining subjects would kill you themselves for betraying them to a fearsome dragon. I have a better idea, however. In exchange for a somewhat burdensome amount of treasure, I will rule you from afar. You will become MY kingdom, and my subjects, and in return for your obedience and tribute I will protect you.

After about a month, a knight arrives at your lair.  She kills a few of your goblin guards perfunctorily—no great loss there—and calls out to you.  "Beast!  I am Dame Elsa.  Queen Juliet has sent me to demand that you end your depredations within her lands.  If you will not, I shall put an end to your threat."

How do you respond?
*choice
    #I present my demands:  if the humans acknowledge me as their ruler and give me adequate tribute, I will cut back on my raiding.
        You fly out of your lair and unleash a blast of flame into the air, causing Dame Elsa's horse to rear uncontrollably.

        "Listen, knight.  If your little queen wants me to stop raiding her lands for money and food whenever I feel like it, she'll have to meet my demands.  She needs to acknowledge that I'm the true ruler of these lands, and she needs to provide me with great tribute in both food and gold.  Otherwise, I will continue to take what I please, when I please.  Is that understood?"

        The knight does not answer at all, except to lower her visor and to set her lance to charge you.  You brush her lance aside with your claw and bite her head off.

        Her fleeing squire carries your message back to the queen.

Eventually, your goblin minions rouse you.  "O great dragon, a large group of humans is outside."

You emerge from your lair to see a small army camped outside under royal banners and flags of truce.  Trumpets sound a fanfare as a human wearing a crown—Queen Juliet, you suppose—walks out of the crowd to meet you.

"Mighty dragon, we would parlay with you.  We have done nothing to offend you.  Why do you despoil our lands?"

How do you respond?

    #Loudly demand that she surrender her lands to my rule and provide me with tribute if she wants to survive.

            She is surprisingly brave to attack you with no hope of success.  She is also surprisingly tasty, as you discover while chewing on her.
