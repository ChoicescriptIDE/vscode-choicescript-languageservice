The next two years pass leisurely.  You sleep on your hoard of treasure, hunt for prey, and occasionally sack a small town for variety.  All in all, you're enjoying a little time without annoying interruptions, when some sort of conjured fiend materializes in front of you. It trails smoke as it hunches before you and claws at the stone floor, bat wings fanning the air. Whatever this thing is, it isn't natural.

The fiend's voice sounds like the movement of many, many slugs. "O mighty ${name}," it gurgles, "the wizard Callax sends his regards. You have been marked for death. And I, or one of my kin, will be your executioner."

Constant interruptions like this make it hard to enjoy all of your treasure.

        This isn't as easy as you expected. It tastes revolting, it isn't hurt by your breath, it's fast, and it isn't entirely real. Chewing it is like trying to bite through a ghost. Its claws hurt, though. The creature leaves rents in your scales and actually manages to break your skin before you slap it into the wall with your tail. It disappears into greasy vapor, laughing.
 
        Magic. One more reason to hate wizards.

    #Question it.
        It chortles as it hears your question. "I am sent by an enemy you didn't even know you had. I am a creature of nightmare, and three other dragons have fallen before my kind. When you are dead, I will eat your soul and wear your flesh as a disguise, and then my master will rule instead of you."

Apparently, the creature that attacked you is a fiend that only the most powerful wizards can summon, a creature of pure hatred and bile that feeds by killing.

At this point, you know enough intimidated humans that someone should be able to give you information. It doesn't take long; Callax is the high mage, whatever that is. He's supposed to be fairly powerful and very proud, someone who likes to succeed and doesn't have much patience for rivals.

                You're going to have to go to the High Tower of Wizardry to see him.  But do you plan to kill him, or to talk first?

        No mercy for one who would oppose you. You are a thunderbolt as you hit the tower from the outside, slamming against it from the air with all of your might. You feel spell-strengthened stones creak and tumble beneath your weight. The top of the tower breaks loose and falls to the ground, and you hear the sound of screams.
        
        "Callax!" you roar. You stick your snout into the top of the tower and breathe flame straight down into the broken structure. "CALLAX!" A sweep of your tail takes out the stables, and you pounce on the first people to flee the structure.

        The wizard doesn't introduce himself when he attacks; he simply hits you with a magical spell from behind.

        "Coward!" you growl, and only a magical globe of water saves him from being flash-fried. "Where are your conjured monsters now?" 

        He looks a little surprised at that.

                        "No!"
                                    
                        You glower. "It said you did. It told me you had slain three other dragons, and I would be your latest victim."

                        "You believed a monster?" Callax looks around at the wreckage and death.  He appears somewhat sick.
                
                        "Silence! If not you, who?"

                        "I think an old enemy of mine is trying to kill you, or to use you as a murder weapon to assassinate me. She calls herself Magister Vermias, although I don't know her real name. She's definitely a conjurer, and she can't stand me."

                        "Has she killed dragons before?"

                        "I don't know for sure, but her staff is supposed to be made from a dragonbone, so the answer might be yes. She lives in the mountains far to the south, and she wants this country as her own. Luckily, she's never been able to raise an army, since no one is stupid enough to follow her. She's crazy and very dangerous."

                        You depart without another word, leaving the dying wizard and burning tower behind.

                A magical spell strikes you, and you can feel your scales turning as soft as butter. That's not good. Both claws slam down onto the wizard before he can react, and you turn him into a gooey paste. Then you're off and flying before anyone can strike you in your newly vulnerable spot. Your enemy is dead, and you're barely hurt. Not bad. On the way back, you can feel your scales hardening again.  They're still softer than they've been in years, but you don't think he's left you permanently vulnerable.  At least, you hope not.

        The Tower isn't far at the speeds you fly, less than an hour away. You land in the courtyard, and there's no doubt that everyone knows you're there. A cowering servant is pushed through a door to find out what you want. Do you want to demand to see Callax, or ask more politely?
        *fake_choice

        Callax strides out the doorway into the courtyard, his body sheathed in magical fires that he thinks will protect him from you. He seems cautious but not afraid. "It is an honor to meet you, ${name}," he says in a clear voice. "To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?"

            #"Why are you trying to kill me?"
                Callax looks surprised. "I'm not trying to kill you. That would be stupid. Why would I do that?"
            #"How many dragons have you killed in your life?"
                He looks surprised. "None. Killing dragons is a dangerous line of work. I have my hands full with human enemies, thank you very much."

                No reason to waste words. You reach out your jaws to devour him, and his protective spells flare into existence. The pain is incredible. You take to the air and blanket the courtyard with fire; he creates a bubble of water to protect himself. He throws a spell at you and you feel it blacken the scales on your belly. The pain increases. Finally, you simply drop on him out of the sky, massive claws ripping and tearing through his magical shields as your bulk pins him down. It takes several minutes and you're badly hurt, but the wizard Callax is dead. You should now be safe.

                "Thus perish all who attack me!" you roar—a little pretentious, perhaps, but you're angry and in pain. You drag yourself aloft and return to your lair. You trail droplets of smoking blood as you fly.

There are two pentagrams carved into the stone of the mountaintop.  They begin to glow, and reddish smoke rises up from the center of each.

If you don't kill her before she finishes the summoning, it might be a little dicey for you.

You turn into a dive to begin your attack run.  As you shoot towards her, Callax shouts above the rushing wind, "Wait, ${name}! Do not attack yet!"

        You rush at Vermias and plunge your claws into her before the summonings can finish.  Where there should be flesh, there is only air and smoke, and a blast of lightning engulfs you.  The energy burns and scars you as it races across your body, wracking you with pain.  Two of your teeth explode, leaving nasty bleeding stumps.  Callax cries out in agony as the lightning blasts through him as well, and his lifeless body topples from your back.  There is no sign of Vermias—you clearly faced a magical trap rather than the wizard herself.

        You unleash a blast of flame on each pentacle, softening the rock itself.  The apparition of Vermias continues muttering her spells, but without the summoning circles, nothing happens.

        Callax nods his head sagely.  "I can trace the magic from the summoning circles back to its source.  Vermias is some fifty miles west of here—if I remember my geography, that's just about right for her to be casting from her tower."

        Fifty miles is an easy flight for you, so you turn towards the west, wings beating a slow and steady pace as you race across the clouds.  You can feel Callax adjusting his grip, desperate not to fall off. "Hold tight, mage," you rumble. 

        This ends today.

You smash through the main door of the tower and begin fighting your way up the tower.  Fighting in the cramped confines of a tower is difficult—it calls for more Finesse and less Brutality.  After you cut through some apprentices as if they were nothing, you reach Vermias.  She waves her dragonbone staff at you and begins chanting tones into the wall that separates this world from the next.  As you lunge at her, things that are not meant to be rally to her aid.

    You battle Vermias, but it becomes increasingly clear that you are outmatched.  You just don't have enough room to maneuver, whereas she is in the seat of her power.  Finally, Vermias summons innumerable hideous crawlers that swarm up your legs and infest your eyes and nose. Blinded, you begin to convulse; soon you feel them burrowing into your brain.  All goes dark.

    The fighting is brutal within the tight confines of her tower. You face dozens of demons, each more hideous than the next.  
    
    But you are more nimble than she expected.  After a long battle, you bite her dragonbone staff in two and eviscerate Vermias.  Your wounds are grievous, but you have triumphed.
    
    Finesse increases.

    It takes you months to recover.  On the upside, you are able to loot her tower fully.  You get quite a nice haul, once you feel up to flying again.
