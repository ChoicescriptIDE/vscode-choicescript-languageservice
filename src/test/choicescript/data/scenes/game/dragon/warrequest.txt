 
As the sun climbs high, you bask yourself on a rock near your lair.  A group of humans slowly make their way up the slope towards you this day.  The humans wear armor and carry weapons, but their weapons are sheathed and they approach respectfully.  These are humans you know.

As they enter the cleared area of stone that surrounds your lair, the humans kneel before you, recognizing your glory.  "O liege," begins the leader, "accept our praise and hear our petition."

You incline your head slightly, acknowledging her and indicating that she may proceed.

"As your magnificence is surely aware, almighty dragon, we are among the knights and lords that hold lands under your magnificence's rule.  We bring tribute each year, and now we come to beg a boon of you."  The knight pauses.  "Our enemies—people like ourselves, but with a mighty army—have begun invading your territory.  They have looted the less well-defended manors and burned some of the fields.  We are readying to fight them, but your magnificence's assistance would greatly strengthen our hand."

One of the other knights interrupts.  "They are taking our animals and chattels and destroying the value of our lands.  You must aid us!"

Your nostrils flare and a wisp of smoke puffs out of them.  He dares to refer to your animals, chattels, and lands as his own?  A grave insult indeed!  How do you respond?

    The minor insult the knight has offered you is far too insignificant for you to address, although you are gratified that the lead knight shushes him quickly.

    "Of course, mighty one," says the leader of the delegation.  "Sir Edmund foolishly misspoke.  We would never presume to make a claim on your rights."

Whatever matter they wished you to handle could not possibly be as important as enforcing your prerogatives.

The humans convene a war council in the area surrounding your lair.

*if (blasphemy > 0)
  As you join them in the council, a steady rain begins to fall.  Their diviners report that the gods are displeased with you.  Still, you are a mighty dragon.  A little divine disfavor won't make much of a difference. 

You lean in closely to read their tiny human maps, nearly killing several squires.

With your support, your minions plan to engage their enemies in a single large field battle.  A decisive victory should end the incursions into your territory and set up an effective counter-attack.

Do you take a role in the center of the battle, relying on your core combat ability, or do you plan on remaining hidden at first and then striking from surprise at a point when the enemy is vulnerable?

Your fiery breath lays waste to their high command; you are then able to attack their knights from the rear, inflicting brutal casualties.
     
      Your troops respond perfectly to the opportunity, smashing the disorganized enemy and triggering a complete rout.  It becomes hard not to giggle, but you avoid it, to maintain morale.

    You slaughter many of the humans, but then it dawns on you that you are fighting not for vengeance but for survival.  Even so, you think that you will be able to escape with your life.  Finally, however, a heavily armored knight charges you and drives her lance deep into your chest.  You struggle to rise despite the mortal wound, but she begins hammering your head with her sword.  All goes dark.
